LittleOS

A standalone x86 operating system has been developed according to [The Little Book about OS Development](https://littleosbook.github.io/) by Eric Helling and Adam Renberg. Branches are separated according to the execution of the chapters of the book. The implementation here is up to integrating outputs.

Additionally, I've written a series of blog articles on media that walk you through the process step-by-step.
